# Maintainer API Keys

## Why API keys?

Scheduled export jobs (cron, CI pipelines, treasury automation) need to call the contributor export endpoints without a human GitHub OAuth session. Forwarding a session cookie to a cron job is:

- **Fragile** — the cookie expires when the maintainer's session does.
- **Over-privileged** — a session carries the maintainer's full identity and all GitHub permissions.
- **Unauditable** — there is no way to distinguish a human export from an automated one in the audit log.

API keys solve all three problems: they are long-lived, scoped to the minimum required permission (`export:read`), and produce a distinct `actorLogin` (`api-key:<name>`) in every audit log entry.

## Security model

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Raw key** | Shown once at creation. Never stored in the database, never logged. |
| **Storage** | Only the SHA-256 hex digest (`keyHash`) is persisted in the `ApiKey` table. |
| **Key format** | `tb_<43 url-safe base64 chars>` (~258 bits of entropy from `crypto.randomBytes(32)`). |
| **Scope** | `export:read` — read-only access to `/api/contributors/export/*`. |
| **Expiry** | Optional ISO-8601 datetime. Expired keys are rejected at the DB lookup step. |
| **Revocation** | Soft-delete (`revokedAt` timestamp set on DELETE). Effective on the next request — no propagation delay. |
| **Rate limiting** | 60 requests per 60 seconds per source IP (in-process sliding window). Returns `429` with `RateLimit-*` / `Retry-After` headers. |
| **Max keys** | 10 active (non-revoked) keys per maintainer. Keeps credential inventory manageable. |
| **Audit trail** | `api_key.created`, `api_key.revoked`, `api_key.use_rejected` written to `AuditLog` on every relevant event. |
| **Plaintext guard** | `isValidApiKeyFormat()` rejects malformed values before the DB round-trip. |

> The rate limiter is in-process. On multi-instance deployments the effective limit is `N × 60` where N is the number of running instances. This is noted in `ENVIRONMENT.md` and acceptable for abuse prevention.

## Creating a key

### Via the settings UI

1. Go to `/dashboard/settings` (requires `operator` or `admin` role).
2. Find the **API keys** card.
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g. `nightly-export-cron`) and click **Create key**.
4. Copy the secret from the green banner — it will **not** be shown again.
5. Store it in your CI/CD secret store (e.g. GitHub Actions secrets).

### Via the API (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/settings/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=<your-session-cookie>" \
  -d '{"name": "nightly-export-cron", "scopes": ["export:read"]}'
```

Response (201):

```json
{
  "key": {
    "id": "cuid...",
    "name": "nightly-export-cron",
    "scopes": ["export:read"],
    "createdAt": "2026-09-25T00:00:00.000Z",
    "expiresAt": null,
    "secret": "tb_Abc123..."
  },
  "warning": "Store this secret now — it will not be shown again."
}
```

> The `secret` field appears only in this response. Subsequent `GET /api/settings/api-keys` requests return metadata only — no secret.

#### Optional: set an expiry

```bash
-d '{"name": "quarterly-audit", "scopes": ["export:read"], "expiresAt": "2027-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'
```

---

## Using a key

Pass the key as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer tb_Abc123..." \
  https://your-deployment.vercel.app/api/contributors/export/csv \
  -o contributors.csv
```

### GitHub Actions example

```yaml
name: Nightly treasury export

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *"   # 02:00 UTC daily

jobs:
  export:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download contributor CSV
        run: |
          curl \
            --fail \
            --retry 3 \
            --retry-delay 30 \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.TRUSTBRIDGE_API_KEY }}" \
            "${{ vars.TRUSTBRIDGE_URL }}/api/contributors/export/csv" \
            -o contributors.csv

      - name: Upload as artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: contributors-${{ github.run_id }}
          path: contributors.csv
          retention-days: 30
```

Store the secret as `TRUSTBRIDGE_API_KEY` in your repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). The URL as a repository variable is optional but keeps workflows environment-agnostic.

## Endpoints protected by `export:read`

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/contributors/export/csv` | Download contributors as CSV |
| `GET` | `/api/contributors/export/json` | Download contributors as JSON |

Both endpoints accept either a maintainer browser session **or** a valid `export:read` API key. A request with neither receives `401 Unauthorized`.

---

## Listing and revoking keys

### List active keys

```bash
GET /api/settings/api-keys
Authorization: Cookie (operator+ session required)
```

Returns the caller's non-revoked keys with metadata (no secret):

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "id": "cuid...",
      "name": "nightly-export-cron",
      "scopes": ["export:read"],
      "createdAt": "2026-09-25T00:00:00.000Z",
      "expiresAt": null,
      "lastUsedAt": "2026-09-25T02:00:05.123Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Revoke a key

```bash
DELETE /api/settings/api-keys/<id>
Authorization: Cookie (operator+ session required)
```

- Sets `revokedAt` immediately. The key stops working on the next request.
- Returns `409 Conflict` if the key is already revoked.
- Returns `403 Forbidden` if the key belongs to a different user.
- The UI shows a confirmation dialog before sending the request.

A revocation is always written to `AuditLog` with `action: "api_key.revoked"`.

## Audit log entries

All key lifecycle events appear in `/api/audit` (visible in the **Recent activity** section of `/dashboard/settings`):

| `action` | When |
|---|---|
| `api_key.created` | Key was successfully created. `metadata` includes `scopes` and `expiresAt`. |
| `api_key.revoked` | Key was revoked by its owner. `targetLabel` is the key name. |
| `api_key.revoke_denied` | A maintainer attempted to revoke a key owned by another user. |
| `api_key.use_rejected` | An incoming request was rejected. `metadata.reason` is one of `revoked`, `expired`, or `insufficient_scope`. |

`actorLogin` for authenticated export requests is `api-key:<key-name>`, making automated exports easy to identify and filter in the audit log.

---

## Error responses

| Status | Body | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| `401` | `{"error":"Unauthorized"}` | No valid session and no valid API key |
| `403` | `{"error":"Forbidden"}` | Session present but insufficient role (management endpoints) |
| `404` | `{"error":"Not found"}` | Key ID not found (revoke endpoint) |
| `409` | `{"error":"Key is already revoked"}` | Revoke attempted on an already-revoked key |
| `422` | `{"error":"Validation failed","details":{...}}` | Invalid request body (create endpoint) |
| `422` | `{"error":"Maximum of 10 active API keys reached..."}` | Key limit exceeded |
| `429` | `{"error":"Too many requests"}` | IP rate limit exceeded; see `Retry-After` header |

---

## Rotating a key

API keys cannot be re-generated — only revoked and replaced. To rotate:

1. Create a new key in the settings UI or via API.
2. Copy and store the new secret in your CI/CD environment.
3. Update workflows / cron jobs to use the new secret.
4. Verify the new key works (run a test export or wait for the next scheduled run).
5. Revoke the old key.

Keeping the old key active until the new one is confirmed working prevents downtime during rotation.

## Database schema

The `ApiKey` model (migration `20260925000000_add_api_key_model`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE "ApiKey" (
    "id"              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    "maintainerOrgId" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default',
    "keyHash"         TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,   -- SHA-256 hex; never the raw key
    "name"            TEXT NOT NULL,
    "scopes"          TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    "createdById"     TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "expiresAt"       TIMESTAMP(3),
    "lastUsedAt"      TIMESTAMP(3),
    "revokedAt"       TIMESTAMP(3),           -- NULL = active
    "createdAt"       TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Indexes: `keyHash` (unique, used for O(1) auth lookup), `createdById`, `createdAt`.
