# Maintainer Workflow

This guide documents operational workflows for TrustBridge maintainers and treasurers, including the `trustbridge-dash` CLI, wave freeze windows, and payout verification.

---

## 1. CLI (`trustbridge-dash`)

The `trustbridge-dash` CLI allows maintainers and automated scripts to export payout data and initiate address rechecks without relying on browser UI sessions.

### Installation & Local Usage

The CLI is registered in `package.json` under `"bin"`:

```bash
# Direct execution via npm/npx or node
./scripts/cli/index.mjs --help
npx trustbridge-dash --help
```

### Commands

#### 1. Login / Credential Setup
Save the target URL and API key locally (stored in `~/.trustbridge/config.json` with `0600` permissions):
```bash
trustbridge-dash login --url https://dashboard.trustbridge.org --api-key <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Alternatively, provide configuration via environment variables:
```bash
export TRUSTBRIDGE_API_URL="https://dashboard.trustbridge.org"
export TRUSTBRIDGE_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

#### 2. Treasury Export
Export contributor readiness and Stellar addresses in CSV (default) or JSON format:
```bash
# Export CSV to stdout or file
trustbridge-dash export --format csv --out ./treasury-export.csv

# Export JSON
trustbridge-dash export --format json --out ./treasury-export.json
```

#### 3. Recheck
Trigger an address verification / readiness check:
```bash
# Batch recheck all contributors (asynchronous background queue)
trustbridge-dash recheck --all

# Recheck a single contributor
trustbridge-dash recheck --username octocat
```

### Security & Protocol Constraints
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Unencrypted HTTP (`http://`) endpoints are strictly rejected by the CLI to protect API keys and contributor information.
- **Log Masking**: API keys and tokens are never printed in full to logs or error outputs.

## 2. Wave Roster Freeze Window

To prevent roster changes or rechecks from shuffling readiness states immediately prior to wave payout settlement:

- **Configuration**:
  - `FREEZE_WINDOW_START` (ISO 8601, e.g. `2026-08-30T00:00:00Z`).
  - `FREEZE_WINDOW_END` (ISO 8601, e.g. `2026-09-02T00:00:00Z`).
  - `FREEZE_WINDOW_ENABLED=true` (or `false` to disable).
- **Behavior**:
  - Mutating operations (`POST /api/register/recheck`, address updates in `POST /api/register`) are blocked during an active freeze window with HTTP `423 Locked` (`code: WAVE_FREEZE_ACTIVE`).
  - Read operations (`GET /api/register`, dashboard viewing) remain fully operational.
  - Blocked attempts are logged in the audit log as `recheck.freeze_blocked` / `address_change.freeze_blocked`.
- **Maintainer Override**:
  - Maintainers can bypass an active freeze window when necessary by supplying header `x-freeze-override: true` or query param `overrideFreeze=true`.
  - Override operations are recorded in the audit log as `recheck.freeze_override` / `address_change.freeze_override`.

---

## 3. Horizon Latency Metrics

- The maintainer metrics dashboard aggregates `horizonLatencyMs` from Horizon address checks.
- Visualizes average latency, median (p50), p95 latency, and sample counts.
- Displays an empty state banner when no samples exist.

---

## 4. Contributor Ban & Unban Management

- Maintainers can ban an abusive or compromised contributor via the maintainer dashboard or `POST /api/maintainer/ban` (`action: "ban"`, `githubUsername: "<username>"`, `reason: "<mandatory reason>"`).
- Banning requires a non-empty reason and applies case-insensitively across current and future account re-registrations.
- Unban via `POST /api/maintainer/ban` (`action: "unban"`, `githubUsername: "<username>"`).
- All actions record audit trail events (`contributor.banned`, `contributor.unbanned`).
